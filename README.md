The developed game allows the player to move across 2 different maps, use a vending machine to purchase items, feed dinosaurs (if the player has an item that they can feed to the dinosaur in their inventory), kill dinosaurs and collect their corpses.

The dinosaurs feed, drink, and breed! If the dinosaur has a sufficient hunger level, they may breed with other dinosaurs. A pregnant dinosaur will produce an egg on the map after a specified amount of turns. The egg then hatches with a baby of the dinosaur egg type, which eventually grows into an adult dinosaur.

Dinosaurs can be:
- Herbivores: Herbivores eat grass and other edible objects.
- Carnivores: Carnivores attack other character and eat their corpses to gain food points.
- Omnivores: Eat edible objects on the map and attack, eat other characters.

The game includes several terrains such as:
- Grass: some dinosaurs feed upon.
- Dirt: appears after the grass terrain has been eaten by a dinosaur.
- Water: only flying characters can move across.
- etc.

The game was developed in Java programming language with the main goals of utilizing and following the SOLID object oriented design principles to keep the application maintainable and extensible.
