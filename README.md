  In a team of three, my group and I work towards adding new features into an already provided engine. The focus of the project was to add the required features while keeping the application maintainable.  Upon creation of the application we tried to keep in mind the SOLID principles of Object Oriented Programming: -   Single Respsibility -   Open / Closed principles -   Liskov Substitution principle -   Interface Segregation Principle -   Dependency Inversion Principle
